# DIP Project – Satellite Image Change Detection

This project is submitted as part of the **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** course.

---

## Project Description

This project focuses on detecting changes between **multi-temporal satellite images**
using **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** techniques.  
It helps identify variations such as **urban growth, vegetation change, and land-use
modification** by comparing satellite images captured at different time periods.

## Techniques Used

- Digital Image Processing (DIP)
- Image Preprocessing
- Change Detection Algorithms
- Satellite Image Analysis
- Deep Learning–based Segmentation Models (experimental)
