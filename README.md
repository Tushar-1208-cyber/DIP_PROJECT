\# DIP Project – Satellite Image Change Detection



This project is submitted as part of the Digital Image Processing (DIP) course.



\## Project Description

This project focuses on detecting changes between multi-temporal satellite images using Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques. It helps identify variations such as urban growth, vegetation change, and land-use modification by comparing images captured at different time periods.



\## Techniques Used

\- Digital Image Processing (DIP)

\- Image Preprocessing

\- Change Detection Algorithms

\- Satellite Image Analysis



\## Folder Structure

\- `7\_classes/` – Core implementation and Jupyter notebooks
